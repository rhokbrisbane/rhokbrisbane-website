%h2 Who have we helped?

%p
  In the last event we helped <a href="http://rsn8.org" target="_blank">Resonate</a> and <a href="http://www.kidzcanzimbabwe.org/" target="_blank">Kidzcan</a>.

%p
  Resonate is a <abbr title="Not for profit">NFP</abbr> social enterprise with a passion for connecting skilled people to local and international causes, around issues they care about.

%p
  Kidzcan is dedicated to increasing the survival rate of children with cancer in a loving and caring environment.

%p
  In 2013 we helped <a href="http://www.queenslandkids.org.au" target="_blank">QLD Kids</a> - The biggest problem that <em>Queensland Kids</em> and their families are facing is being able to access the services and information available to them.

%p
  We hacked solutions to bridge this gap, taking advantage of all the existing resources, open data, and technology solutions we could find.
