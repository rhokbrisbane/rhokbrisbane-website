            Random Hacks of Kindness Brisbane (RHoK) is a not for profit local group that is part of a global movement of hackers who are hacking for good around the world. We invite participants to work together to produce practical open source solutions to problems affecting the developing world.
          </p>
          <h2>What is RHoK?</h2>
          <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rhok.org/">RHoK</a>
            is a global hackathon that takes place twice a year. It was started in 2009 by Google, NASA, Yahoo!, Microsoft and the World Bank, and since then RHoK has been bringing together thousands of people around the world to create open source solutions that can save lives and alleviate suffering. RHoK Brisbane events are aimed at encouraging participants to develop solutions that can be used, in particular, to help people in the developing world including Africa, Haiti and Australia. Brisbane hosted its first hack event in December 2013 (part of the final global hackathon).

          <h2>Who have we helped?</h2>
          <p>
            In the last event we helped to hack against Ebola, and to hack solutions for <a href="http://www.techgirlsaresuperheroes.org/" target="_blank">Techgirlsaresuperheroes.org</a> and <a href="http://karuna.org.au/" target="_blank">Karuna.org.au</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Earlier in 2014 we helped <a href="http://rsn8.org" target="_blank">Resonate</a> and <a href="http://www.kidzcanzimbabwe.org/" target="_blank">Kidzcan</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Resonate is a <abbr title="Not for profit">NFP</abbr> social enterprise with a passion for connecting skilled people to local and international causes, around issues they care about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kidzcan is dedicated to increasing the survival rate of children with cancer in a loving and caring environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013 we helped <a href="http://www.queenslandkids.org.au" target="_blank">QLD Kids</a> - The biggest problem that <em>Queensland Kids</em> and their families are facing is being able to access the services and information available to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hacked solutions to bridge this gap, taking advantage of all the existing resources, open data, and technology solutions we could find.
